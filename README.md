# lein-amp
Generates an Alfresco Module Package (AMP) file from your project.
See http://wiki.alfresco.com/wiki/AMP_Files for more details on the AMP file format.
See http://wiki.alfresco.com/wiki/Module_Management_Tool for details on how to deploy AMP files to an Alfresco installation.

Also see https://github.com/mstang/alfresco-amp-template for a `lein new` template that will create a skeleton project of this type.
It is highly recommended that you generate new AMP projects using this template.

What is it useful for?

AMPs are the standard for deploying extensions to the [open source Alfresco content management system](http://www.alfresco.org/).
Being able to develop such extensions in Clojure, therefore, requires the ability for leiningen to emit AMP Files - this plugin adds
that capability.

## Installation

lein-amp is available as a Maven artifact from [Clojars](https://clojars.org/org.clojars.pmonks/lein-amp).
Plonk the following in your project.clj, `lein deps` and you should be good to go:

```clojure
  :profiles {:dev      { :plugins [[lein-amp "#.#.#"]] }
             :provided { :dependencies [
                                         [org.clojure/clojure         "1.6.0"          :scope "runtime"]
;                                         [org.clojars.pmonks/lambdalf "2.0.0-SNAPSHOT" :scope "runtime"]  ; SOON - NOT YET DEPLOYED TO CLOJARS!
                                       ]}
```

The latest version is:

[![version](https://clojars.org/org.clojars.pmonks/lein-amp/latest-version.svg)](https://clojars.org/org.clojars.pmonks/lein-amp)

## Usage:
```shell
$ lein amp package
$ lein amp deploy [<path-to-alfresco>]   # Not implemented yet!
```

The `package` task builds an AMP file from your project.
The `deploy` task (not yet implemented) will deploy that AMP to an Alfresco installation.
